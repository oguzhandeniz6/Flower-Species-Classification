# Flower-Species-Classification
Flower Species Classification with a custom ID3 decision tree algorithm and a custom prune algorithm.

In this project, flower species classification is carried out using a custom ID3 decision tree algorithm and a custom pruning algorithm. Results before and after pruning are compared, and rule sets are also extracted and compared.

Additionally, a different feature extraction method was attempted using image processing techniques.
